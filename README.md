# Awesome Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) for Academics and Researchers

A curated list of open resources to support **Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)** with a special focus on academic workflows, research, note-taking, and writing.  
Includes ready-to-use Obsidian and Logseq vaults, Zotero workflows, plugin setups, blog posts, videos, and more.

> Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list format.

## Why This List?

While many PKM resources exist, few speak directly to the needs of:
- PhD students juggling reading, writing, and experiments
- Researchers building long-term knowledge
- Academics managing teaching, research, and grant writing

This collection focuses on **open-source**, **reproducible**, and **academic-friendly** PKM systems.
